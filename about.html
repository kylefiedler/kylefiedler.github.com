    <p>When I'm not trying to wrangle my family, I most likely have my nose in a book (ok, Kindle). We call Austin our home but I grew up just north of New York City and have made my way through Boston and Philadelphia. I'm a big baseball fan, especially the Yankees, and I'm slowly making my way to each baseball park. Running is an escape for me and a way to de-stress; during quarentine I've picked up trail running. Tea, beer, and coffee are my drinks of choice. </p>

    <ul>
      <li class="u-margin-bottom-base">
        <h3>Be sustainable</h3>
        <p>Maintain energy and patience to build and strengthen relationships. Life is a marathon not a sprint, but make the best use of time that youâ€™ve been gifted. Don't waste or create waste.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="u-margin-bottom-base">
        <h3>Spread kindness &amp; support others</h3>
        <p>Give as much as you can to those who have less. Help lift others to give them a chance to rise. Amplify voices that might have otherwise gone unheard.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="u-margin-bottom-base">
        <h3>Always iterate</h3>
        <p>Nothing is ever flawless, and nothing is ever done. There is always room to grow and improve in every aspect of life. Do not rely on anyone else to set your direction or hold you accountable.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="u-margin-bottom-base">
        <h3>Contribute to something bigger</h3>
        <p>What you decide to work on and who you work on it will define who you are and will define the community around you. Leave everything better than you found it.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="u-margin-bottom-base">
        <h3>Simple is imperfect</h3>
        <p>Add purposefully and remove when possible. Avoid justification of the new and see the value in what you already have. Embrace inconsistencies, mistakes, and flaws.</p>
      </li>
