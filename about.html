  <h1 class="title--primary">A product designer and strategist trying to make some good on the internet.</h1>
  <p class="u-margin-bottom-base">I use research and Jobs-to-be-Done to understand complex problems; then design, and implement practical solutions. I&rsquo;ve been designing web or mobile products in some form or another for over fifteen years. For about seven of those years, I&rsquo;ve been managing and leading the teams I'm on. At home, I&rsquo;m partner to an accomplished photographer and father to three kids and two dogs (we have a wild house).</p>

    <li><p>I&rsquo;m motivated and fulfilled working projects that align with <a href="/values">my values.</a></p></li>
    <li><p>I spend a lot of time reading both fiction and non-fiction.</p></li>
    <li><p>Our family calls Austin home, but I grew up just north of New York City and have made my way through Boston and Philadelphia.</p></li>
    <li><p>Running is an escape for me and a way to de-stress; during quarantine, I’ve picked up trail running. There is something about getting away from everything and running uphill on rocks that just does it.</p></li>
    <li><p>I’m a big baseball fan, especially the Yankees. I love listening to baseball games on the radio outside on a summer night. Before COVID, I loved going to <a href="/lists/baseball-stadiums">visit each of the baseball stadiums</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p>I’m probably eating a taco.</p></li>
