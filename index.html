  <h2 class="title--primary">@ Work</h2>
  <p>I&rsquo;m a product designer and strategist. I use research and Jobs-to-be-Done to understand complex problems, then design, and implement practical solutions. As a Design Manager, I create a space for designers to do their best work, work on product strategy, and gain alignment across teams throughout the organization.</p>

  <h2 class="title--primary">@ Home</h2>
  <p>I&rsquo;m partner to an accomplished photographer and father to three kids, three dogs, and two birds. <em>It&rsquo;s wild up in here.</em> My success metrics are measured in eye rolls, fart jokes, and belly rubs. We call Austin home but I still consider myself to be a <span class="gif">New Yorker<img src="/images/gifs/new-yorker.gif" alt="A animated gif from Curb Your Enthusiasm saying Mind your own business"></span>.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I read a bunch; fiction, non-fiction, and comic books. <span class="gif">Mountain <img src="/images/grafixs/about-1.jpg" alt="A trail in the woods that dissapears into trees with mountains in the background"></span> biking, is an escape for me. There is something about biking uphill on rocks that brings me sadistic joy. And, I waste a bunch of time playing video games.</p> 
  <p class="mb--large">I love listening to <span class="gif">baseball games <img src="/images/grafixs/yankee.JPG" alt="A photo of Yankee stadium looking out to home plate from center field"></span> on the radio outside on summer nights. Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve managed to find myself <a href="/lists/plants">taking care of a lot of plants.</a> I can&rsquo;t get enough of the texture and feeling of putting my hands in dirt.</p>

    <p>I like making lists, I like crossing out lists, forgetting I made lists or losing lists, and then duplicating
      lists. <em>I just like lists.</em>
