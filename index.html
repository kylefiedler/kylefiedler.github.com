  <h1><span class="gif">Hi!<img src="/images/gifs/hi.gif" alt="A animated gif of Forrest Gump waving"></span> I&rsquo;m Kyle</h1>
  <p>I&rsquo;m fairly basic, thoroughly <span class="gif">introverted<img src="/images/gifs/introverted.gif" alt="An animated gif of Moira Rose from Shitt's Creek saying 'You keep everything inside like a bashful clam'"></span>, overly <span class="gif">sarcastic<img src="/images/gifs/sarcastic.gif" alt="An animated gif of Fozzy Bear looking for laughs"></span>, and delightfully <span class="gif">awkward<img src="/images/gifs/awkward.gif" alt="An animated gif of a man weidly looking out from plants"></span>. I use my constant curiosity <em>to make myself and the people around me better.</em></p>
  <p>Over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve been slowly working through pre-pandemic <span class="gif">burnout<img src="/images/gifs/burnt.gif" alt="An animated gif of a man rubing his hands down his face in exaustion"></span> and a pandemic induced fatigue.</p>

  <p class="indent">I&rsquo;m partner to an accomplished photographer and father to three kids, three dogs, and a bird. It&rsquo;s wild up in here. My success metrics are measured in eye rolls, fart jokes, and belly rubs. We call Austin home but I still consider myself to be a <span class="gif">New Yorker<img src="/images/gifs/new-yorker.gif" alt="A animated gif from Curb Your Enthusiasm saying Mind your own business"></span>.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>I like lists. I like making lists, I like crossing out lists, forgetting I made lists or losing lists and then duplicating lists. These are some of my lists, but you can check out <a href="/lists">all my lists.</a></p>

  <p class="indent"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16097193-kyle-fiedler">I read a bunch</a> â†—; both fiction and non-fiction. Running, especially trail running, is an escape for me. There is something about running uphill on rocks in that brings me some sadistic joy. </p>

  <p class="indent">I love listening to baseball games on the radio outside on summer nights. I draw and paint, but let&rsquo;s face it, I&rsquo;m not the best at finding the time. Same deal with meditating. Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve managed to find myself <a href="/lists/plants">taking care of a lot of plants.</a> At least, more than I thought I would ever own.</p>
