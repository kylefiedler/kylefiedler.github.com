  <h1>Hi, I&rsquo;m Kyle! I plan, design, test, and build digital products. I encourage, support, and mentor other designers as Chief Design Officer at&nbsp;<a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>.</h1>

  <p>I enjoy working through complex problems and coming up with simple solutions. I use tools such as research, design thinking, design sprints, and Jobs-to-be-done to help me best understand what a product is trying to solve. I ship early and iterate. I enjoy a well-made peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cut in two triangles. <a href="mailto:kyle@kylefiedler.com">Drop a line.</a></p>
