  <h2 class="title--secondary">At work</h2>
  <p>I&rsquo;m a product designer and strategist. I use research and Jobs-to-be-Done to understand complex problems, then <a href="https://dribbble.com/kylefiedler/" target="_blank">design</a> <span class="entity">&#8599;</span>, and <a href="https://github.com/kylefiedler/" target="blank">implement</a> <span class="entity">&#8599;</span> practical solutions. </p>

  <p class="mb--large">After a few years as an individual contributor, I am back to managing a team of designers. My focus is to create a space for those designers to do their best work, make sure they&rsquo;re progressing in their career, and are fulfilled at work.  I provide design feedback, wrangle stakeholders, work on product strategy, and gain alinment across teams throughout the organization. <em class="green">Easier said than done.</em></p>

  <h2 class="title--secondary">At home</h2>
  <p>I&rsquo;m partner to an accomplished photographer and father to three kids, three dogs, and two birds. <em>It&rsquo;s wild up in here.</em> My success metrics are measured in eye rolls, fart jokes, and belly rubs. We call Austin home but I still consider myself to be a <span class="gif">New Yorker<img src="/images/gifs/new-yorker.gif" alt="A animated gif from Curb Your Enthusiasm saying Mind your own business"></span>.</p>

  <h2 class="title--secondary">In my free time</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16097193-kyle-fiedler">I read a bunch</a> <span class="entity">&#8599;</span>; fiction, non-fiction, and comic books. <del>Running</del> <span class="gif">Mountain <img src="/images/grafixs/about-1.jpg" alt="A trail in the woods that dissapears into trees with mountains in the background"></span> biking, is an escape for me.

  <p class="mb--large">I love listening to <span class="gif">baseball games <img src="/images/grafixs/yankee.JPG" alt="A photo of Yankee stadium looking out to home plate from center field"></span> on the radio outside on summer nights. I draw and paint, but let&rsquo;s face it, I&rsquo;m not the best at finding the time. Same deal with meditating. Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve managed to find myself <a href="/lists/plants">taking care of a lot of house plants.</a> I&rsquo;ve also started two raised bed gardens outside to grow vegetables to eat. I can&rsquo;t get enough of the texture and feeling of putting my hands in dirt.</p>
