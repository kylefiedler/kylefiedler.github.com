<h1 class="heading-1">I encourage, support, and coach designers.</h1>

<section class="split-layout">
  <p>At 🤖 <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>, I'm creating an environment for designers to be fulfilled in their work. I iteratively plan, design, test, and build digital products. I rely on tools like Jobs-to-be-Done to work through complex problems and come up with appropriate solutions. </p>

    Personal Values

  <p class="split-layout">These values define who I would like to be 😀 and what is personally important. I revisit these values at the end of every year to recommit to myself who I am.</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="split-layout split-layout--border-bottom">
      <h3 class="heading-3">Be sustainable</h3>
      <p>Maintain energy and patience to build and strengthen relationships. Life is a marathon not a sprint, but make the best use of time that you’ve been gifted. Don't waste or create waste.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="split-layout split-layout--border-bottom">
      <h3 class="heading-3">Spread kindness &amp; support others</h3>
      <p>Give as much as you can to those that do not have. Help prop up others when they need propping up. 📢 Amplify voices that might have otherwise gone unheard.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="split-layout split-layout--border-bottom">
      <h3 class="heading-3">Always iterate</h3>
      <p>Nothing is ever flawless, and nothing is ever done. There is always room to grow and improve in every aspect of life. Do not rely on anyone else to set your direction or hold you accountable.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="split-layout split-layout--border-bottom">
      <h3 class="heading-3">Contribute to something bigger</h3>
      <p>What you decide to work on and who you work on it will define who you are and will define the community around you. 🏕 Leave everything better than you found it.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="split-layout split-layout--border-bottom">
      <h3 class="heading-3">Simple is imperfect</h3>
      <p>Add purposefully and remove when possible. Avoid justification of the new and see the value in what you already have. Embrace inconsitancies, mistakes, and flaws.</p>
