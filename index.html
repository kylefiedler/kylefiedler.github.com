  <h1><span class="gif">Hi!<img src="/images/gifs/hi.gif" alt="A animated gif of Forrest Gump waving"></span> I&rsquo;m Kyle</h1>
  <p>I&rsquo;m fairly basic, thoroughly <span class="gif">introverted<img src="/images/gifs/introverted.gif" alt="An animated gif of Moira Rose from Shitt's Creek saying 'You keep everything inside like a bashful clam'"></span>, overly <span class="gif">sarcastic<img src="/images/gifs/sarcastic.gif" alt="An animated gif of Fozzy Bear looking for laughs"></span>, and delightfully <span class="gif">awkward<img src="/images/gifs/awkward.gif" alt="An animated gif of a man weidly looking out from plants"></span>. I use my constant curiosity <em>to better myself as well as the people around me.</em></p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m a product designer and strategist. I use research and Jobs-to-be-Done to understand complex problems, then <a href="https://dribbble.com/kylefiedler/" target="_blank">design</a> ↗, and <a href="https://github.com/kylefiedler/" target="blank">implement</a> ↗ practical solutions. </p>

  <p class="indent">At home, I&rsquo;m partner to an accomplished photographer and father to three kids, three dogs, and a bird. It&rsquo;s wild up in here. My success metrics are measured in eye rolls, fart jokes, and belly rubs. We call Austin home but I still consider myself to be a <span class="gif">New Yorker<img src="/images/gifs/new-yorker.gif" alt="A animated gif from Curb Your Enthusiasm saying Mind your own business"></span>.</p>

      <h2>So Many Lists</h2>
      <p>I like making lists, I like crossing out lists, forgetting I made lists or losing lists, and then duplicating lists. <em>I just like lists.</em> These are some of my lists, but make sure you check out <a href="/lists">all my lists.</a></p>

  <h2>In my free time</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16097193-kyle-fiedler">I read a bunch</a> ↗; both fiction and non-fiction. <del>Running</del> <span class="gif">Mountain <img src="/images/grafixs/about-1.jpg" alt="A trail in the woods that dissapears into trees with mountains in the background"></span> biking, is an escape for me. There is something about <em>biking uphill on rocks that brings me sadistic joy.</em></p>
  
  <p class="indent">I love listening to <span class="gif">baseball games <img src="/images/grafixs/yankee.JPG" alt="A photo of Yankee stadium looking out to home plate from center field"></span> on the radio outside on summer nights. I draw and paint, but let&rsquo;s face it, I&rsquo;m not the best at finding the time. Same deal with meditating. Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve managed to find myself <a href="/lists/plants">taking care of a lot of plants.</a> At least, more than I thought I would ever own.</p>
