<h1 class="heading-1">I encourage, support, and coach designers.</h1>

<section class="split-layout">
  <p>At 🤖 <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>, I'm working to create an environment for designers to be fulfilled in their work. I iteratively plan, design, test, and build digital products. I rely on tools like Jobs-to-be-Done to work through complex problems and come up with appropriate solutions. </p>

      <h2 class="heading-3">Be sustainable</h2>

      <h2 class="heading-3">Always iterate</h2>
      <p>Nothing is ever flawless, and nothing is ever done. There is always room to grow and improve in every aspect of life. Do not rely on anyone else to set your direction or hold you accountable.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-3">Contribute to something larger</h2>
      <p>What you decide to work on and who you work on it will define who you are and will define the community around you. 🏕 Leave everything better than you found it.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-3">Simple is imperfect</h2>
      <p>Add purposefully and remove when possible. Avoid justification of the new and see the value in what you already have. Embrace inconsitancies, mistakes, and flaws.</p>
