<section class="about">
  <h1>A profound statement about me would go right here. But I can&rsquo;t think of anything.</h1>
  <p>I am digital product designer and Managing Director at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>. Most of the time I am soft spoken, even though I try not to be. I love drinking craft beer, watching baseball, eating Mexican food and spending time with my family. What I enjoy most, though, is creating things that work well and look good.</p>
