        <h3 class="span-four">Be sustainable</h3>
        <p class="span-six u-margin-baseline-align">Maintain energy and patience to build and strengthen relationships. Life is a marathon not a sprint, but make the best use of time that youâ€™ve been gifted. Don't waste or create waste.</p>

        <h3 class="span-four">Spread kindness &amp; support others</h3>
        <p class="span-six u-margin-baseline-align">Give as much as you can to those who have less. Help lift others to give them a chance to rise. Amplify voices that might have otherwise gone unheard.</p>

      <li class="sub-ten u-margin-bottom-base">
        <h3 class="span-four">Always iterate</h3>
        <p class="span-six u-margin-baseline-align">Nothing is ever flawless, and nothing is ever done. There is always room to grow and improve in every aspect of life. Do not rely on anyone else to set your direction or hold you accountable.</p>

        <h3 class="span-four">Simple is imperfect</h3>
        <p class="span-six u-margin-baseline-align">Add purposefully and remove when possible. Avoid justification of the new and see the value in what you already have. Embrace inconsistencies, mistakes, and flaws.</p>
