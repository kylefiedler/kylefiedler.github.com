    <h3 class="data--quote">The Challenge</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span-4 mt--base">
    <p>Despite strong brand recognition for individual products like MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle, most developers didn’t realize they were all built by the same company—Consensys. As a result, developers’ journeys into Web3—and through Consensys tools—were fragmented. Product adoption, activation, and engagement happened in silos, without a cohesive experience.</p>
    <p>To solve this, I partnered with researcher Tyreek Houston to better understand how developers move from initial interest in Web3 to launching successful decentralized applications—and how Consensys products could better support them along the way.</p>

<section class="grid seven border-top">
  <div class="span-3 border-right">
    <h3 class="data--quote">Discovery &amp; Alignment</h3>
    <p>I began by interviewing nine internal stakeholders across product, design, sales, and marketing to understand:</p>

    <ul class="circle">
      <li>Their perspective on the current developer journey</li>
      <li>Pain points and opportunities they observed</li>
      <li>What success would look like from this work</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also met with product leads to learn how each tool fits into the developer lifecycle and collected supporting documentation—product onboarding flows, marketing assets, sales decks, and internal research.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Mapping the Current Developer Journey</h3>
    <p>After synthesizing our interviews and documentation, I created a visual map of the end-to-end developer journey—from first exposure to Web3 through to launching a live dApp. The map revealed key patterns:</p>
    <ul class="circle">
      <li>
        The journey was fragmented and non-linear
      </li>
      <li>
        Product awareness was strong individually, but brand cohesion was weak
      </li>
      <li>
        Onboarding, activation, and engagement often happened in isolation
      </li>
      <li>
        Developers didn’t realize Consensys tools could work together
      </li>
    </ul>

<div class="span-3">
  <h3 class="data--quote">Collaborating Through Workshops</h3>
  <p>We hosted two workshops to refine the journey map and explore next steps:</p>
  <ul class="number">
    <li>Assumption-Busting Workshop: We invited a cross-functional team to critique the journey map and surface overlooked gaps or friction points.</li>
    <li>Solution Framing Workshop: We shifted focus from mapping to imagining what a more seamless, integrated experience could look like.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These workshops helped strengthen buy-in across teams and identified opportunities not only for product improvements but also for cross-product storytelling and packaging.</p>

  <h3 class="data--quote">Validating with User Research</h3>
  <p>With a more complete journey map in place, Tyreek conducted qualitative research with developers to validate our assumptions and highlight areas for improvement. Key takeaways:</p>
  <ul class="circle">
    <li>Developers want toolchains that “just work together”</li>
    <li>Seamless integration is more valuable than just individual features</li>
    <li>Awareness of Consensys as a unified brand was still low</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This validated our internal hypothesis and surfaced clear opportunities to simplify onboarding and deepen engagement across multiple Consensys tools.</p>

<div class="span-3 border-right">
  <h3 class="data--quote">Designing the Ideal Journey</h3>
  <p>Building on this, we mapped out an ideal developer journey—a path where Consensys tools are integrated into a clear, supportive ecosystem. We envisioned:</p>
  
  <ul class="circle">
    <li>Tools that hand off smoothly from one to the next</li>
    <li>Shared onboarding patterns and educational content</li>
    <li>More proactive product packaging for specific developer goals</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We aligned this vision with internal frameworks like the DevU North Star metric and Matthieu Bouchaud’s growth loops for Infura—ensuring that we had measurable checkpoints along the journey and could design meaningful growth loops at each stage of the dApp lifecycle.</p>
  <h3 class="data--quote">Sharing & Socializing the Work</h3>
  <p>We presented the journey map and ideal state to product leadership across Consensys, and made the work accessible internally to anyone interested. It now serves as a shared foundation for aligning roadmaps, product strategy, and marketing efforts across the developer experience.</p>

  <h3 class="data--quote">Results &amp; Impact</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span-4 mt--base">
    <p>This project created a shared understanding across Consensys of how developers move through the Web3 ecosystem—and how our products can better support them.</p>

    <p>Outcomes:</p>
    <ul class="circle">
      <li>A unified Developer Journey Map adopted across product, research, and marketing</li>
      <li>Integration opportunities identified across Infura, MetaMask, Truffle, and Linea</li>
      <li>Used as a strategic artifact in cross-functional planning and product packaging</li>
      <li>Guided by internal frameworks like DevU North Star and Infura growth loops</li>
      <li>Shared with product leaders and used in ongoing roadmap planning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This work laid the foundation for a more integrated developer experience and helped shift internal conversations from siloed tools to a holistic product ecosystem.</p>
