    <h3 class="data--quote">Setting the stage</h3>
    <p>Our CMO, Lindsey Christensen, identified the website as a key opportunity to improve lead generation for our sales team.</p>

    <p>We recognized several core issues:</p>
    
    <ul class="circle">
      <li>The site lacked a consistent voice and tone</li>
      <li>The UX and visual design were inconsistent</li>
      <li>There was no long-term content strategy</li>
      <li>It lacked a CMS, making even simple updates difficult for the Marketing team</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lindsey and Elaina Natario, a designer from our Boston studio, began documenting internal and external pain points. I supported the process by offering feedback, historical context, and guidance throughout.</p>
    <p>We used this early audit to define clear Jobs-to-be-Done across three audiences: our marketing team, prospective clients, and internal contributors.</p>
    <h3 class="data--quote">Understanding users and their journey</h3>
    <p>To complement the internal research, I conducted Jobs-to-be-Done–style interviews with clients to uncover their motivations and decision-making timeline. These interviews helped validate our assumptions and revealed how and when the site influenced their buying journey.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="span-4">
    <p>Once we had alignment on problems and outcomes, we realized the site redesign needed to start with a stronger foundation: a consistent brand system.</p>
    <p>Lloyd Bennett and Miles Johnson, designers from our London studio, led the creation of a refined visual identity. I partnered with Lindsey to give strategic feedback and approve deliverables. Their work became the cornerstone of every design decision that followed.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Reworking the content strategy</h3>
    <p>While the brand work progressed, Lindsey and I took on a complete audit of the website content. Much of it was company-centric, not user-focused, and failed to speak to client goals or outcomes.</p>
    <p>We rewrote each core page—starting with Services—to better reflect the challenges our audience faced and clearly communicate how we could help.</p>

    <h2>Designing a flexible component system</h2>
    <p>As content patterns emerged, I began designing a component system—or “slices”—that could support a variety of storytelling needs across the site.</p>
    <p>I collaborated closely with Tyson Gach, our NYC-based Design Director, to define the underlying data model and evolve the visual design. Tyson also led a massive code refactor, giving us a clean base to build and ship from.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Building with Prismic</h3>
    <p>To move quickly, we focused first on structure—implementing content and layout components in Prismic. This allowed us to validate the design system and ensure it worked across all key pages.</p>
    <p>In tandem, we aligned our content audit to the new components, making it easy for the Marketing team to create or update pages without needing design or dev support.</p>
    <p>Tyson and I also created documentation for the slice system to guide content creation and ensure consistency going forward.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Results</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span-4">
    <p>The project was a win across the board:</p>

    <ul class="circle">
      <li>Bounce rate dropped by 23.5%</li>
      <li>Conversion rate increased by 29%</li>
      <li>Content was rewritten to speak with our audience, not at them</li>
      <li>The majority of the site moved into a CMS, enabling the Marketing team to own and scale content independently</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The project culminated in a workshop we led at thoughtbot titled “There’s a typo on the homepage!”—a lighthearted look at the power of collaboration, process, and systems thinking.</p>
