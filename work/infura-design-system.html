  </div>
  <div class="span-4 mt--base">
      <p>Infura’s design had fallen behind user expectations—and competitors. We regularly heard feedback from users that the UI felt disjointed, dated, and inconsistent. Years of fast-paced feature work had created a tangled component system. There were over 10 types of buttons used across the product, many of them one-offs. Components were inconsistently implemented in both Figma and code.</p>
  
      <p>The result:</p>
      
      <ul class="circle">
        <li>Design and engineering were duplicating work</li>
        <li>Shipping new features took longer than necessary</li>
        <li>The overall experience lacked the polish users expected from a developer tool of our scale</li>
      </ul>

  <h3 class="data--quote">Getting Started</h3>
  <p>I kicked off the project by reviewing feedback already collected by our support and product teams. Using this, I wrote a proposal outlining key problems and a plan to tackle them, with clear, tangible success metrics:</p>
  
  <ul class="circle">
    <li>Reduce time from design to production</li>
    <li>Increase design consistency and reduce the number of components to maintain</li>
    <li>Improve user satisfaction and retention—eliminate UI as a reason for churn</li>
  </ul>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Visual Exploration & Stakeholder Alignment</h3>
    <p>I began by exploring updated visual styles for Infura’s core app screens, using recent brand design work as a starting point. After refining with feedback from the brand team and design leadership, I opened the work to broader input from the design and frontend teams.</p>
    <p>Once we had early alignment, I broke the exploration down into core components we knew the app needed. I took inventory of the full interface and mapped components to real usage across the product. I organized this work using Atomic Design principles, to help guide structure and communication.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Rebuilding the System, One Component at a Time</h3>
    <p>For each component, I followed a full design-to-implementation lifecycle:</p>
    
    <ul class="circle">
      <li>Update the design in Figma</li>
      <li>Implement in React Storybook</li>
      <li>Integrate into the app</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each step informed the others. As new edge cases emerged during integration, I revisited and refined components in Figma and Storybook. Since I was also managing the project, I had visibility into where gaps were forming—and could quickly resolve them across design and engineering.</p>

          <h3 class="data--quote">Shipping in Iteration, Not All at Once</h3>
          <p>Rather than waiting for a big relaunch, we shipped components as they were completed. This meant users experienced a gradual improvement over time—never a jarring change—and gave the team time to adapt to new patterns organically.</p>
          
          <p>We also used each rollout as a chance to fix small UI/UX bugs that had accumulated. This not only improved the experience but clarified which components should be used where, reducing future inconsistencies.</p>
          
          <h3 class="data--quote">Results & Impact</h3>
          
          <p>The design system overhaul led to significant improvements across design, engineering, and user satisfaction:</p>
          
          <ul class="circle">
            <li>Faster time from design to production for new UI features</li>
            <li>Reduced component count by over 56%, improving maintainability</li>
            <li>Fewer UI bugs, more than 53 tickets cleared, and clearer component usage across the codebase</li>
            <li>Zero user complaints about design during post-rollout churn analysis</li>
            <li>Improved collaboration between design and engineering through shared language and documentation</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>This wasn’t just a visual refresh, it rebuilt the foundation for how we shipped product at Infura. The end result: a cleaner, more unified user experience that scaled with our team and our users.</p>
