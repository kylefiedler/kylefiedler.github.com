  <p>A few months into my management role at MetaMask, I observed a recurring issue: inconsistencies in how designers approached decision-making. These inconsistencies were becoming apparent in the interface, negatively impacting the user experience. Addressing this problem required a structured approach to identify and resolve conflicting design decisions.</p>

  <h2 class="title--secondary">Identifying and Documenting Conflicts</h2>
  
  <p>To tackle the issue, I created a shared document to catalog the design conflicts I had noticed. This document outlined specific examples of inconsistencies, ranging from accessibility issues to variations in interaction patterns. I shared this initial draft with a select group of designers to gather their perspectives. Many resonated with the challenges I outlined, confirming that these conflicts were systemic.</p>
  
  <p>Next, I engaged the Design Leadership team to discuss how best to address these conflicts. Leadership validated my observations and encouraged me to drive the initiative forward. With their support, I formed a small working group to brainstorm and propose solutions for each conflict. Some issues, such as ensuring accessibility compliance, had straightforward fixes, while others required deeper discussion and exploration.</p>

<h2 class="title--secondary">Driving Alignment and Team Buy-In</h2>
<p>Once the working group had developed solutions, I organized the information into a FigJam board. This visual format made it easier to present the conflicts and proposed resolutions to the broader design team. To foster engagement and collect feedback, I facilitated a red-yellow-green voting exercise. This exercise allowed team members to express their agreement, concerns, or suggestions for each conflict and its corresponding solution.</p>
<p>The feedback was invaluable. It highlighted scenarios we hadn’t initially considered and clarified areas of confusion. Based on this input, I refined the solutions and updated the documentation to reflect the team’s collective insights.</p>

<h2 class="title--secondary">Institutionalizing Solutions</h2>

<p>To ensure the solutions were accessible and actionable, I organized them into our team’s Notion workspace. I presented the final outcomes during a design sync meeting and shared them in our design and product Slack channels. By embedding these solutions into our workflows, I ensured they would be referenced and utilized whenever similar conflicts arose.</p>

<h2 class="title--secondary">Impact</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved Design Consistency:</strong> The documented solutions have become a cornerstone for decision-making, helping designers create more cohesive and user-friendly interfaces across all three of MetaMask’s core products.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Collaboration:</strong> The structured feedback process brought the team together, fostering a sense of shared ownership and alignment on design principles.</li>
  <li><strong>Better User Experience:</strong> Consistent design decisions have directly contributed to a more seamless and intuitive user experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalable Framework:</strong> The process and documentation now serve as a scalable framework for addressing future design conflicts, enabling continuous improvement within the team.</li>
</ul>

<p>This initiative not only resolved immediate inconsistencies but also established a culture of collaboration and accountability, ensuring that design decisions at MetaMask align with both user needs and team standards.</p>
