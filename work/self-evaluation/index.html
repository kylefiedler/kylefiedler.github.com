  <h2>Opportunity</h2>
  <p>The Designers at thoughtbot are generalists. They can work directly with stakeholders on design thinking workshops, then turn around and work in code. Because the role is broad, Designers struggled with identifying areas of growth, as well as classifying weaknesses.</p>

<section class="u-margin-bottom-large">
  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>I wanted to create a tool that would allow Designers to see their progress in regards to skill growth. This would give them additional direction and the ability to more closely focus on skill development. Learn more about the process on the <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/designing-designer-skill-growth">thoughtbot blog</a></p>
