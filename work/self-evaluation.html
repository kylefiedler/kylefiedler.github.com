<h1><span class="highlight">Designers leveling up</span> with the Skill Self-Evaluation</h1>
<p>The Designers at thoughtbot are generalists. They can work directly with stakeholders on design thinking workshops,
  then turn around and work in code. Because the role is broad, Designers struggled with identifying areas of growth, as
  well as classifying weaknesses.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a tool that would allow Designers to see their progress in regards to skill growth. This would
  give them additional direction and the ability to more closely focus on skill development.

  process on the <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/designing-designer-skill-growth">thoughtbot blog</a></p>
