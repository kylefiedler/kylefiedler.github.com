  <p>KOYA was created to bring people together and spread kindness in a unique way that couldn't be achieved in person. They did this with a twist of surprise and delight in everyday tasks and activities. With Koya, you have the ability to purchase a coffee for your mom who lives across the country, or buy your best friend a drink in Philly when you're located in San Francisco.</p>

  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>The founders of KOYA first approached us with a Design Sprint to help them validate their ideas and design a prototype. We then re-engaged for short bursts of design work as they built out their MVP.</p>
