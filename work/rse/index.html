    <p>Real Simple Energy came to thoughtbot with a problem and idea. They saw people struggling in the Houston area by selecting private electricity providers. The providers use sneaky techniques to trick people into plans that won't be best for them. That's where Real Simple Energy steps in.</p>

    <p>Our team was fully remote with the RSE team in Dallas and Houston and thoughtbot team in Austin and NYC. The timeline for the project was tight. We kept what features we launched with low by running a remote design workshop, conducting Jobs-to-be-Done switch interviews, rapidly prototyping, and continually evaluating scope as a team.</p>
