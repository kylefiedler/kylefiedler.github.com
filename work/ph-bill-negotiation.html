  <div class="span-4 mt--base">
    <p>One of Point Health’s core offerings is helping members lower their medical bills through negotiation. Until recently, this was entirely handled by phone and one-off emails. Each Patient Advocate managed their own caseload manually, acting as both project manager and point of contact. We saw an opportunity to bring this offering into the mobile app to increase the number of people we could help—and to better support Advocates in managing their workload.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Immersing in the Current Process</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="span-4 mt--base">
    <p>Before designing anything, I needed to deeply understand how bill negotiation worked. I spent several half-days shadowing our Patient Advocate team—listening to calls, watching them triage cases, and observing how they handled negotiation follow-ups. </p>
    <p>This not only gave me a solid grasp of the operational flow, but also a feel for the emotional weight of these interactions—how stressed members often were, and how much energy Advocates spent guiding them through the process.  </p>

    <h2 class="data--quote">Mapping the Experience and Gathering Input</h2>
    <p>Using Whimsical, I mapped out the information collected during calls and began exploring what could be shifted into the app. I collaborated closely with our Chief Product Officer, another designer, and the Advocate team to refine the intake experience.</p>
    <p>Once I felt confident in the proposed flow, we reviewed it together in a Product Strategy Meeting to align on scope and direction.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Prototyping a Minimal, Impactful First Version</h3>
    <p>The team aligned on a clear goal: build the most lightweight version possible to start learning fast. I focused on the onboarding experience, which Advocates described as repetitive and tedious. By collecting all the essential information in the app, Advocates could begin their work with far less back-and-forth.</p>
    <p>To keep the scope tight, I left the negotiation follow-up process out of the prototype—those interactions would remain phone-based for the time being. I continued gathering feedback from Advocates and stakeholders throughout prototyping and iteration.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Adding Messaging to the Experience</h3>
    <p>After reviewing the prototype, stakeholders identified an opportunity to improve retention by encouraging members to stay within the app—rather than defaulting to phone calls. We decided to experiment with in-app messaging.</p>
    <p>I worked closely with our front-end developer to evaluate third-party messaging solutions. We landed on Stream—it covered our immediate use cases and allowed us to move quickly. Using Stream’s UI Kit, I created a refined prototype to align the team on business value and guide engineering estimates.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Refining the Experience Through Collaboration</h3>
    <p>We discovered that much of the interaction between members and Advocates relied on predictable, repeatable questions. With minimal extra engineering effort, we improved the experience to feel more like a structured, conversational flow.</p>
    <p>We ran usability testing with internal and external testers to refine the interaction patterns and tone. We also looped in our navigation team to pressure-test the member flow.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Designing for Advocates</h3>
    <p>Once the member experience was in place, we turned our focus to Advocates. I designed an interface that allowed them to view active cases, respond quickly, and stay organized. It was critical that their experience be just as seamless as the member-facing one—this tool needed to reduce their workload, not add to it.

  </div>
  <div class="span-4 mt--base">
    <ul class="circle">
      <li>
        Faster onboarding: Cut Advocate onboarding time per case by ~30%, allowing them to take on more cases per week.
      </li>
      <li>
        Member engagement: Messaging saw higher-than-expected engagement rates, with over 60% of members responding within the first day.
      </li>
      <li>
        Technical velocity: Stream integration allowed engineering to deliver a working prototype in under 2 sprints.
      </li>
      <li>
        Positive team feedback: Advocates reported that having structured case info upfront “felt like a weight lifted.”
