    <p>Infura was preparing to expand its Ethereum API to support additional networks—Near and Aurora. This posed a
      unique challenge: Near is a standalone Layer 1 blockchain, not part of the Ethereum ecosystem. It was the first
      non-Ethereum Layer 1 network to be accessed via the same API Key, and we anticipated confusion from developers
      around this model.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Mapping the Developer Journey</h3>
    <p>To get grounded in the experience, I stepped through our ideal developer journey for adding new networks to an API Key. I documented each step in FigJam and quickly encountered several points of friction.</p>
    <p>Curious about the scale of the problem, I turned to our analytics. I traced drop-offs in the funnel—from API Key creation to actual network requests—and discovered a common pattern: many developers created a Key but never sent a request. This confirmed we weren’t effectively guiding users to the "aha" moment.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote mt--base">Running a Design Jam</h3>
    <p>I organized a Design Jam with product and design collaborators to prioritize problems and surface opportunities. The workshop uncovered two critical tracks to pursue:</p>
    <ul class="circle mt--base">
      <li>Short-term – A quick fix to help developers start sending requests to Near and Aurora immediately.</li>
      <li>Long-term – A redesign to clarify the role of API Keys across multiple networks and build user understanding of decentralized app (dApp) setup.</li>

      <p>Post-workshop, we recognized a knowledge gap: we didn’t fully understand how developers were currently choosing networks or organizing multi-network dApps.</p>
      
      <p>To close this gap, I:</p>
      <ul class="circle mt--base">
        <li>Queried our analytics to identify active users utilizing multiple networks.</li>
        <li>Reviewed hundreds of accounts to shortlist candidates for interviews.</li>
        <li>Reached out to ~100 users and conducted 5 in-depth interviews.</li>
        <li>These sessions uncovered how teams were structuring their projects, when and why they used different networks, and how the concept of a single API Key felt unintuitive or limiting.</li>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Defining the Challenge</h3>
   </div> 
  <div class="span-4 mt--base">
    <p>Working closely with our PM, we distilled the research and workshop insights into three key "How might we" statements:</p>
    <ul class="circle">
      <li>How might we design a system that scales seamlessly as more networks are added?</li>
      <li>How might we help users quickly choose the right blockchain/network for their needs?</li>
      <li>How might we clarify that a single API Key spans all supported networks?</li>

        <h3 class="data--quote">Prototyping the Vision</h3>
        <p>With alignment around our direction, we made several foundational shifts:</p>
        <ul class="circle">
          <li>Renamed the "Ethereum API" to Web3 API to reflect its broader scope.</li>
          <li>Began exploring UI concepts to educate users about API Key behavior and reduce friction in activating new networks.</li>
          <li>To communicate these ideas, I built a low-fidelity prototype in Figma that sketched a new user flow for adding and managing networks.</li>

      <h3 class="data--quote">Driving Alignment Across the Organization</h3>
      <p>To build momentum, I facilitated a cross-functional workshop with 40+ stakeholders—product, design, engineering, sales, and marketing. We used the prototype to walk through key findings from our research and preview our proposed changes.</p>
      <p>The workshop generated strong alignment and fast-tracked decisions. Our PM later said it was the most effective workshop they’d ever participated in.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Preparing for Implementation</h3>
    <p>While the low-fidelity prototype represented our long-term vision, we needed to scope down to a shippable version. I began work on a high-fidelity prototype that could move us closer to that vision, while still being feasible within a few weeks.</p>
    <p>One UX challenge: how to display endpoints clearly. Our design system didn’t have existing components to represent endpoint states (e.g., active, inactive). I explored new component patterns to address this gap.</p>
    <p>Once the design was approved, I built a code prototype to ensure a smooth handoff to our frontend developer. This not only clarified interaction intent but also sped up implementation—ultimately helping us deliver the new endpoints faster.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote">Iteration 2: Improving Clarity and Security of the Unified Web3 API Key</h3>
    
    <p>With the initial designs in place, I ran an unmoderated usability test to evaluate one of our key challenges:</p>
    
    <p class="detail mt--base mb--base">How might we help users understand that a single API Key spans all supported networks?</p>

    <p>Using Maze, our team’s unmoderated testing platform, I tested the updated flow with 26 users over several months. While the results showed some improvement in user understanding, it was still clear that many users didn’t fully grasp that one Key could access multiple networks.</p>

  <div class="span-3 border-top">
    <h3 class="data--quote">A New Direction</h3>
    <p>Together with the PM, we took insights from the usability study and post-launch incidents to plan the next iteration. Around the same time, our backend team merged all endpoints—previously separated (e.g., IPFS and Filecoin)—into a single unified Web3 API. This allowed us to present an even more streamlined experience under one Key.</p>
    <p>We set three goals for the new iteration:</p>
    
    <ul class="circle">
      <li>Help users clearly understand what the Web3 API Key enables and how to organize their usage</li>
      <li>Improve the default security of all API Keys</li>
      <li>Reinforce that all networks now live under the same Web3 API Key</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="data--quote">Designing the New Flow</h3>
      <p>After aligning with the PM, we decided that users would need to activate networks individually under their Key. This gave them better control and reinforced what their Key could access. With a clear vision in mind, I jumped straight into high-fidelity mockups.</p>
    <p>I quickly wrapped up the designs and presented them to both product and engineering teams. Their feedback helped simplify a few interactions and strengthen how we communicated endpoint scope and usage.</p>

  <div class="span-3 border-top border-right">
    <h3 class="data--quote">Final Handoff & Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>Because of the engineering team’s roadmap, there was a delay between when design was completed and when frontend development began. This created some challenges during handoff—but having high-fidelity mocks and documentation ready helped bridge the gap.</p>

    <h3 class="data--quote mt--large">Results & Impact</h3>
    <p>The two iterations of endpoint improvements led to measurable gains in both usability and security:</p>

  <ul class="circle">
    <li>📈 13.6% increase in users successfully sending their first request after creating an API Key</li>
    <li>🧠 25.7% improvement in user understanding of multi-network access (based on Maze testing)</li>
    <li>🔒 12.3% reduction in reported cases of compromised API Keys due to open defaults</li>
    <li>🤝 Cross-team alignment: Two large-scale workshops brought together over 40 people across design, product, engineering, and marketing</li>
  </ul>
    <p>Beyond the metrics, the project shifted how Infura talks about its API—from a single-chain “Ethereum API” to a unified Web3 API—setting the stage for future scalability across chains and user growth.</p>
