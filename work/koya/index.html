    <p>KOYA was created to bring people together through kindness that couldn't be in person. With a twist of surprise and delight with everyday activities. Buy your mom, in New York, a coffee when you're in Austin. Buy your best friend a drink in Philly when you live in Boston.</p>

    <p>The founders of KOYA approached us first with a Design Sprint to help them validated their ideas and design a prototype. We then re-engaged for short bursts of design work as they built out their MVP.</p>
