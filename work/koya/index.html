  <h2 class="span-four start-three">Opportunity</h2>
  <p class="span-ten">KOYA was created to bring people together and spread kindness in a unique way that couldn't be achieved in person. They did this with a twist of surprise and delight in everyday tasks and activities. With Koya, you have the ability to purchase a coffee for your mom who lives across the country, or buy your best friend a drink in Philly when you're located in San Francisco.</p>
