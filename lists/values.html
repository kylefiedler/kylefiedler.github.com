      <h2 class="title--secondary">Always iterate</h2>
      <p>Nothing is flawless, and nothing is complete. There is always room to grow and improve in every aspect of life. Do not rely on anyone else to set your direction or hold you accountable. Leave it better. Know when to have persistence and grit. Think through problems like a scientist. Embrace mistakes as learning opportunities. Use your constant curiosity to improve yourself and those around you. Treat your growth like a well-tended garden.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="span-3">
      <h2 class="title--secondary">Radical practicality </h2>
      <p>Add purposefully and remove when possible. Avoid justifying the new and see the value in what you already have. Embrace inconsistencies, mistakes, and flaws. Nothing is ever perfect. Provide consistent value in what you create. Theory without execution is worthless.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="span-3 cell--first">
      <h2 class="title--secondary">Bring your authentic selfÔ∏è</h2>
      <p>Have authenticity in everything that you do. Be transparent, honest, and accountable. Give space for everyone else to be themselves, too. Let people feel their feelings. Don&rsquo;t tell them how to feel. Have the courage to be kinder. Treat trust like a savings account and make lots of small deposits so that when you need to make a withdrawal you&rsquo;re not in the negative.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="span-3">
      <h2 class="title--secondary">Slow and Steady </h2>
      <p>The fastest way isn&rsquo;t through; it&rsquo;s taking your time and being thoughtful. Do more reps with less weight to avoid injury. Take that extra deep breath. Have patience. When you rush to get something done, you inevitably have to redo it, spending more time than if you had just done it right the first time.</p>
