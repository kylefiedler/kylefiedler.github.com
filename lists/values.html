  <h1>My Personal Values</h1>
  <ul class="circle">
    <li class="mb--base">
      <h2 class="title--secondary">Slow and Steady üê¢</h2>
      <p>Slow down and take your time with things. Not everything needs to be done now, there will be a tomorrow. Maintain energy and patience. Look to build sustainably. Some of the best relationships, plants, coffees, beers and tools need time to grow and ferment. Treat everything like a garden, steady maintinence over a long time.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb--base">
      <h2 class="title--secondary">Do good, Be good ‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>
      <p>Give as much as you can to those who have less. Help lift others to give them a chance to rise. Amplify voices that might have otherwise gone unheard. What you decide to work on and who you work on it with will define who you are. Leave everything better than you found it.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb--base">
      <h2 class="title--secondary">Always iterate ‚ôªÔ∏è</h2>
      <p>Nothing is flawless, and nothing is done. There is always room to grow and improve in every aspect of life. Do not rely on anyone else to set your direction or hold you accountable.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb--base">
      <h2 class="title--secondary">Simple is imperfect ü™¥</h2>
      <p>Add purposefully and remove when possible. Avoid justification of the new and see the value in what you already have. Embrace inconsistencies, mistakes, and flaws.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
