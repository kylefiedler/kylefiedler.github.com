  <h1>2024 Goals</h1>

<ul class="circle">
  <li class="mb--large">
    <h3>Be outside</h3>
    <p>Spend as much time biking and hiking as possible. Grow a garden from seeds. Put your hands in dirt everyday. Try camping again. Take the dogs for walks everyday. Soak in the sun, breathe the air, and enjoy the view. Talk to every cactus.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="mb--large">
    <h3>Be bored</h3>
    <p>Embrace time not scheduled. Love the in-between moments. Don&rsquo;t always have a book or podcast on in the background. Don&rsquo;t feel the need to fill every moment with false productivity. Buy less. Allow your mind to wander. Let the boredom plant seeds of creativity and find your voice with art again.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="mb--large">
    <h3>Be forgiving</h3>
    <p>Practice mindful forgiveness for yourself and others. Don&rsquo;t hold on to guilt and trauma. Practice acceptance. Let go of things you can&rsquo;t control and even those you can. Forgive events and roles that happened in the past. Move on from them. Turn over a new leaf. 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="mb--large">
    <h3>Be present</h3>
    <p>Continue to evolve meditation practice. Be better at listening. Look into people&rsquo;s eyes. Breathe. Figure out how to stop the ever present urge to check your phone. In fact, leave your phone behind. Learn about stoicism and minimalism. Stop yearning for something new and cherish what you have right now.
