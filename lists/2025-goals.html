  <h1>2025 Goals</h1>
</header>

<ul class="grid seven">
  <li class="span-3">
    <h2>Be optimistic </h2> 
    <p>Appreciate what you have, from the small to the large. Find deeper enjoyment of your everyday things. Be present. Keep a journal all year. Buy less. Focus on the good, don&rsquo;t focus so much on the negative. Let those things go. Think about the best outcomes. Let it always be sunny. </p>
  </li>
  <li class="span-3">
    <h2>Be thoughtful</h2> 
    <p>Write again and publish your thoughts. Don&rsquo;t let ChatGPT do it for you, though. Keep trying to push yourself creatively. Do something thoughtful for the people you love that shows them how important they are to you.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="span-3 cell--first">
    <h2>Be fit</h2> 
    <p>Keep doing strength a few times every week. Keep losing fat and gaining muscle. Be the strongest that you&rsquo;ve ever been. Be lean. Keep mountain biking too, though you don't really need encouragement for that, and don&rsquo;t get hurt doing it. </p>
  </li>
  <li class="span-3">
    <h2>Be even more bored</h2> 
    <p>Continue to not feel the need to fill every moment with noise. Continue to give space for your mind to wander. Leave your phone behind.  Draw, read, play.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
