  <h1>First one-on-one rules and questions for my reports</h1>
  <p>This is the list of questions I run through during my first one on one with new reports. It gives me an immediate baseline understanding of what makes that person tick and how I might be able to best help them. I&rsquo;ve blatently stole many of these questions from <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/">Lara Hogan's list</a> but adapted them to me over time.</p>
