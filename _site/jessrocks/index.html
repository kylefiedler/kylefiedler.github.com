          <p>Just got back from Disney World a couple days ago, and it was *AMAZING!* We went December 19th-26th and truly had a magical time. I was so thankful to be able to give Hayley such a memorable trip. One of my close friends who lives in Tampa with her family was also able to join us for a couple days! Here are a just a few of my favorite pictures from it - I admit that I took over 1,000. :|</p>
