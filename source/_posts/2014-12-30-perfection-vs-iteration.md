title: The difference between a perfectionist and iterating

A college ceramics professor once did a test with their students. They split the class in half and told one half that their grade depended on how many pots they could make during the semester. They told the other half of the class that their grade depended on the quality of one pot. It needed to be the nicest pot they could make. All the students that had to make the most pots churned out pots as fast as they could. Trying desperately to make them faster than the next. The other half focus on just one pot. They tirelessly worked to make that one pot perfect.

At the end of the year the professor had the students who made as many pots as possible to hand in the last pot they had made that year. The professor then grouped those pots with the ones of the second group that had to make one perfect pot. Then outside he had outside artists and professors come in and comment on the quality of the ceramics. They all overwhelmingly chose the pots from the students that were forced to make as many pots as possible. The craftsmanship behind those pots were far superior to those of the other group.
