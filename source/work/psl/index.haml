    %p I was asked to redesign and rebrand the PSL marketing website. The goal for the site was to exemplify the thriving startup community in Philly, and to give people an idea of current happenings and worthy activities in the area.

    %p I wanted to showcase the people behind the Philly startup scene. I saw a great photo from a recent PSL event and felt it was a perfect fit for my vision. I used it as a backdrop in order to set the tone that the organization is welcoming and creative.
