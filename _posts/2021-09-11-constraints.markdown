This week [Kottke linked out to Brushy One String's Tiny Desk Concert](https://kottke.org/21/09/brushy-one-string) and I've been listening to his music ever since (including right now). True to his name Brushy One String plays a guitar with only one string. Playing a one-string guitar came to him in a vision, and he had to make that vision come true. He relies on his voice, one string, and drumming on the guitar to create powerful music.

Visions aside, I'm always amazed at how different people create their own constraints and creativity. In design, to make great products, we need to understand the constraints from business and market to engineering. Working within these constraints allows us to create powerful products.
