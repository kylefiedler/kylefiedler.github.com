  <h1><span>On</span> Fresh Starts</h1>

  <p>There is something thrilling about a fresh start. It's a blank canvas waiting for paint. You get to define what is to come and discard what came in the past. There is now space to rethink process, and analyze every moment through it. It allows for more growth and better results. </p>

  <p>But starting fresh is hard work. Usually, its easier to use the scaffolding that has been established. To build off whats there or fix something that is broken. It's a rare case when it's not. Fresh starts are time consuming, stressful, and you're not guaranteed a better outcome than what you had.</p> 

  <p>I hadn't posted on this site for quite some time and throughout that time I wished I hadn't stopped. What I saw though, when I looked back was a platform that didn't reflect me as a designer, developer or person. This to me was a glaring problem. What is this site if not a reflection of who I am?</p>

  <p>When I started the redesign, I found myself lost. I couldn't get to a solution that I found acceptable to the goals which I set out to solve. At points I lost sight of those goals too, which made the process long and more drawn out.</p>

  <p>I feel what I have now is finally at a state that I can accept. I, again, have a platform to get better at writing and a playground for designing around that writing.</p> 

  <p>Heres to fresh starts.</p>
