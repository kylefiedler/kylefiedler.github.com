I finally got around to some of the older articles in my Instapaper. I found <a href='https://danmall.com/posts/what-is-a-design-system/'>Dan Mall&rsquo;s &ldquo;What is a Design System?&rdquo;</a> encouraging. I&rsquo;ve come across so many different definitions of what a design system is and almost hate calling things design systems because of the confusion or expectation that people have with them.
