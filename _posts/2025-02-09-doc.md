I ran into [Doc](https://www.doc.cc) a few months ago and have been slowly reading through the article backlog. Personally and professionally, Iâ€™ve found several explorations of topics from [Simplicity](https://www.doc.cc/articles/simplicity) to [Craft](https://www.doc.cc/articles/craft) quite timely. Each explores concepts that can be difficult to discuss or explain at times. Not every point is agreeable, but they are a great starting point for ephemeral and ethical theory.
