<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>It's been over a year since my last post. Over that time I've gotten engaged and married, started a new job (it's not new anymore), moved twice, started a business with a friend and done a <em>ton</em> of design. That&rsquo;s a lot. It explains to me why something had to go. Unfortunately, it was this site</p>

<p>This will be my third attempt at maintaining a blog and the second time that I have abandoned one. It's not that during that time I didn't want to write for this site it's just that I didn't make time for it. </p>

<h2>Insane</h2>
<p>The definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and thinging that you'll get different results. Well that is pre icky what I am trying to do. For the third time I am restarting a blog expecting to actually stay with it this time. Crazy. Probably, but its something that I can just not let die. At least not yet. </p>

<p>This time like the last I am going to set out with some new goals and guidelines. </p>

<h2>Schedule </h2>
<p>Last time I tried to hold myself to a once a month post. This was perfect for me at the time. It held me to deadlines and made me write something that I hated to do and needed encouragement to do. I think tht it led to some posts that were rushed and subpar. Now I don't think that that is the case. I don't need that encouragement. I am not going to stick to any kind of schedule. I'll post when I have something to say. </p>

<h2>Illustration</h2>
<p>I want to add a little bit more of my personality into my posts and bassicaly just wanted an excuse to use my Wacom and draw. </p>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>For the most part, the comments on my blog were congratulatory, which are awesome, but I never had a real conversation in them. For now I'm not going to implement comments on my site. I am going to have a new email address set up so that perhaps if people want to comment they can have a more real conversation about the post. This could change.</p>
