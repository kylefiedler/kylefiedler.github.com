A lot of current trendy product and marketing design involves motion; transitions in and out of pages that fade and out, loading states that giggle, buttons that pop. It layers on the delight. Forces it into your eyeballs. Freaks out your CPU too.

This is where I get to be an old man and say, “When I started doing design on the web. we were lucky to have five typefaces.” Kids these days.

My personal site has always been a bit of a playground for me, a place to test out new ideas that I couldn’t on other projects. Once upon a time, it was even art-directed. I’ve put some weird constraints on my designs like: What if you only use one typeface at one size? It’s produced some interesting and sometimes awful results but that's kind of the fun of having your own playground.

My current test is: what if it didn’t move, can you still make it trendy and cool?
