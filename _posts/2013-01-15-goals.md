---

I&rsquo;m not one for resultuions so to speak but I do like to revisit my current goals everyonce and a while and the beginning of the year is as good of a time as any. I figured it was time to look over, update and add new goals to the list. What follow is what I have currently:

* Take lots of photos
* Be more social
* Become a better writer
* Make less decisions
* Be more fiscally responsible
* Be less fiscally responsible
* Draw a lot
* More water less tea
* Make art again
