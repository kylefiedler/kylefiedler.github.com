title: Things I learned by doing 3 talks in 3 days in Chicago
---

I've spent the last few days in Chicago. During my trip I gave 3 talks in 3 days. It was a little grueling but I learned a lot about speaking and a lot about my self. Things that if they were spaced out I think I would miss out on.

- I say "ummm" and "so" a lot.
- If I have presenter notes up I will read them (and not look at my audience). 
- I am mentally exhausted after giving a talk and  need alone time after to recharge.
- I love answering questions more than preparing the talk.
- It's awesome to have video of your talk.
- Practice. Practice. Practice.
- No amount of good feedback will change my mind about how well or not well I did.
- There is only so much talking my throat can take.
- The room makes a big difference.
- I talk with my hands even though I think I don't.
- I actually talk at a good pace.
- Simple slides are the best kind of slides.
- I'm not nearly as nervous as I used to be.
- I want unbiased feedback and advise on how to get better at talking but can't get it.
