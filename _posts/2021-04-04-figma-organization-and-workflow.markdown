I've been taking some time to pay down some design debt on a project and have been digging deep into how to best organize a team's Figma workflow. Here's a list of resources that I've found useful so far in diving in:

* [Component architecture in Figma](https://medium.com/figma-design/component-architecture-in-figma-f16ae9cc4481)
* [Figma Workflow on the Viget Product Design Team](https://www.viget.com/articles/figma-workflow-on-the-viget-product-design-team/)
* [Figma components team library. Boost your design workflow](https://kamushken.medium.com/meet-multicomponents-in-figma-b1e122f6dbaa)
* [Creating a more collaborative and efficient process when migrating to Figma](https://uxdesign.cc/creating-a-more-collaborative-and-efficient-process-when-migrating-to-figma-f2c26c9c1df3)
* [Office Hours: Mastering components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=fNQRXierLhQ)
