[Cross-Cultural Design](https://abookapart.com/products/cross-cultural-design) by [Senongo Akpem](https://senongo.net) is a great introduction read on how to start to think and tackle design across language, location and culture. Yet another book that I wish that I had 15 years ago to help me think about how my design work impacts those that don't look and think like I do. Instead I learned the hard way, by conducting so many interviews.
