<p>One of the things my art teacher taught me when I was painting was never use black paint. This is because you&rsquo;ll never actually see real black. It simply doesn&rsquo;t exist. In reality, what seems black is really a deep blue, brown, red or combo of those colors. Anyway you look at it, the black has some tone to it. So I never painted with true black paint.</p>

<p>Lately, I have been trying to stop using gray and black in all of my design work too. I&rsquo;ve started to realize that when I use strait gray or black the design seems lifeless, fake and unhappy. This is because the black has no real tone.</p>
