<p>I&rswuo;m getting quite tired of analogies for how we as web designers work. Maybe its just the context that I always hear them in but they always seem whiney. Designing for a screen is different. It&rsquo;s not print design, it&rsquo;s not product design, it&rsquo;s not architecture. We can and should learn a lot from these industries but we shouldn&rsquo;t rely on them to dictate our profession. </p>

Designing for a screen is different. The sooner that you accept that the sooner we can move on as an industry. Stop complaining. Start doing.
