It's amazing how much things can get out of prospective for me. I live a really good helathy life. I've surrounded myself with people that I love and they love me. When the smallest thing doesn't go my way I tend to over exaggerate how bad it is. Its nice to see things like this to put me back in my place. 

From another angle it is really inspiring that such young people can demostrate such maturaty. If I can be half of the person Zach is I will really proud of myself.
