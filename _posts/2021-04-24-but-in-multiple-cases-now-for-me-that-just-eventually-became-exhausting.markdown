&ldquo;Eventually the amount of energy and effort that I needed to put in to just maintain my own role outstripped the energy that I had to actually be effective in my role.&rdquo;

I spent a good amount of time during December last year thinking through what was next for me in my career. I found the interviews from [staff.design](https://staff.design/) helped me along the way to figuring out what I should be looking for next. I found the interview with [Wilson Minor](https://staff.design/wilson-miner) especially relatable.
