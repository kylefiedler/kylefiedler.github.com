A friend and former coworker, [Sameera Kapila](https://samkapila.com/), has writen a book! [Inclusive Design Communities](https://abookapart.com/products/inclusive-design-communities) is a must read for anyone in the design industry. Here's what I wrote on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5071929146?book_show_action=true):

Inclusive Design Communities is a gift. Sameera builds your understanding of inclusion, then shows you how that understanding can be applied to education, hiring, leadership and wider online and in person communities. While it focuses on design industry, the content applies to all people that want to be a part of inclusive teams and communities.

Inclusive Design Communities should be required reading for any working in technology. I know that I will be returning to it again and again in the future to refresh my comprehension of what I've learned.
