![So You Want to Talk About Race Cover](/images/posts/so-you-want-to-talk-about-race-cover.jpg)

It's on [Sam's book list for inclusion](https://samkapila.com/inclusion/) and [Gordon](https://gordonfontenot.com) says it's ["Required reading"](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3370282185?book_show_action=false). They're smart people. I wish I read this book more than a decade ago.
