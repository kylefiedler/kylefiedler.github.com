Since I'm back in the car driving kids to school, I've been catching up on podcasts that I've missed over the last year and a half. Season six of [Revisionist History](https://www.pushkin.fm/show/revisionist-history/) was just as brilliant as the first several seasons. It's one of my favorite podcasts to escape the industry of design and product while also not escaping it. It was the first podcast that I wanted to pick back up.
I love the small glimpse into Malcom Gladwell's brain and thought process while he investigates the seemingly "overlooked and misunderstood."

The last episode explains why we don't deserve dogs. [Give it a listen.](https://www.pushkin.fm/episode/the-dog-will-see-you-now/)
