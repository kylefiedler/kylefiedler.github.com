I love reading anything that [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2021/the-green-ray/) writes. It's all just so good. At any rate, this passage caught me by surprise, I've never thought about inverted seasonal affective disorder before. September has always been a struggle for me since moving to Austin. The super hot months of July and August are over, kids are back in school, and in my brain that means mid-80s temperatures. But here in Texas, we're still many weeks away from cooling off.
