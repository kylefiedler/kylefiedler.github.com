I grew up watching Mr. Rogers&rsquo; and really enjoyed the overview of Mr. Rogers teachings in [The Radical Theology of Mr. Rogers](https://lifeisasacredtext.substack.com/p/the-radical-theology-of-mr-rogers#footnote-anchor-2-129387508).

The final list of Mr. Rogers&rsquo; themes caught me offgaurd as they&rsquo;re not so different than [my personal values](lists/values):

> As far as I can tell, entirety of Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood can be summed up as:
>
> - What matters is slowing down to make sure others win, too.
> - It’s OK to talk about difficult things.
> - Making sure every kid is cared for, safe, fed, loved should be our number one priority.
> - Cultivate empathy.
> - Be curious.
> - We all have hard feelings sometimes.
> - And most of all, love your neighbor as yourself.
