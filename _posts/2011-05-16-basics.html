<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>I've, probably unfairly, created a distaste for wordpress. I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops to create a post. Now that I look back it was ridiculous the amount of hoops I needed to jump through. I'd have to design develop and post all in multiple different environments. It's was crazy.</p>

<p>From now on I will be using good ol' HTML and CSS to write and share my articles served up with Jekyll. </p>

<p>Jekyll let's me easily create a general frame for the site and posts. </p>

<p>When it comes down to it I don't need anything more. With the way I'd like to design my articles almost every cms will get in the way. It would have many features that a I wouldn't need or use. The exact opposite of what it should be.</p>
