<p>Lately, I have been doing a lot of thinking about creativity and its juxtaposition to making. I have always hated the thought that I am a capitol C &ldquo;Creative&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t really believe such people exist. Really everyone is creative, and most of the more creative people I have met are&rswuo;t in a design or arts field.</p>

<p>I have always felt like my ideas were. What I always considered myself was a doer and maker. Where other people had better ideas then me I was much more willing and capable to make those ideas or convey those ideas.</p>

<p>After watching the two presentations in this post on having ideas and working through the ideas, I feel validated in that thinking. Take a look at both they are certainly worth the watch.</p>
