I resonated so strongly with [The Curse of the Perfect Tool](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-curse-of-the-perfect-tool) and finding that perfect tool. I certainly have the habit of trying out too many tools and have waisted many hours trying to find that perfect one. Initially it was task apps. I hopped from one to another trying to find the "best" one. I just spent more time switching from app to app than I did executing on my tasks. My new tool to overthink is notes applications. I’ve tried them all in the hopes that one would fit me just right. They don’t.
