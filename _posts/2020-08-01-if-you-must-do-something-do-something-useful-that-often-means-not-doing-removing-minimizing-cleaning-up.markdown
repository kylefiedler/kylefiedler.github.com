From ["Webwaste"](https://alistapart.com/article/webwaste/) by Gerry McGovern. This was a thought provoking read. Just because what we make is through a screen we typically don't think about the impact that it might have outside of the electronic setting it's in. Quantifying web pages weight in the amount of impact it's having on the environment might be more valuable than in the space it's taking up on a hard drive.
