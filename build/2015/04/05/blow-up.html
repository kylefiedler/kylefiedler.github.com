    <h1>Lets blow this fucker up, again</h1>
    <p>One of the goals for relaunching this site was to teach me a lesson in iteration and motivation. I wanted to see how badly I could push a redesign over two nights on a weekend and then see how much I could iterate on top of that. I’ve managed to keep up and build something that I am sort of proud of. Throughout that process though, the design time has taken away from what the original goal I had, to write more. So while visually it made me feel better about my online presence it didn’t accomplish what I wanted.</p>

<p>Recently, one of <a href="http://kylefiedler.com/2015/02/22/launching-incomplete.html">my articles</a> gave <a href="http://chuise.com/2015/03/18/self-destruction/">Kevin the shot in the arm that he needed</a> to start again on his site. This is better than any other outcome than I could have hoped with the site and it was my shitty words and not the average design that drove him to redesigning. For the longest time, I’ve wondered if anything I had to say actually mattered. It’s one of the reasons that this site stayed as a giant portrait of myself. To inspire a designer that I admire is certainly proof that it might.</p>

<p>So I’m blowing this thing up again. I want to go back to focusing on the words and I want the design to reflect that. It’s where I want to improve as a designer and it’s where I hopefully can have a bigger impact. Lets face it I’m not going to blow anyones mind with my visual design but just maybe I’ll be able to reach out and inspire someone other than Kevin to design from a different angle.</p>

          Our playbook touches upon how we use Trello for all sorts of tasks, from projects to hiring to sales – however, it doesn’t dive deeply into how we manage our boards for each project. Each of our project boards are broken down into 6 columns: Ideas / Discussion, Next up, Doing, Code Review, Acceptance, and Week of.

          <p>We want to create stronger ties between Philly’s technology and sports communities. That’s why Philly will be joining Boston and Montreal in hosting a Baseball Hack Day, a one-day event to encourage the development of baseball-related tech projects, partnerships and experiments. It kicks off March 28 at CityCoHo on 24th and Walnut.</p>

          <p>I launched my site knowing it was far from perfect. It wasn’t responsive. It didn’t display any particularly appealing animations. It was lacking polish in several places. Regardless of this knowledge, I still chose to launch.  </p>

          <p>Before each design sprint that I lead, I formulate an initial plan in order to feel confident about the schedule going into the sprint. admit that this process is a bit haphazard. To frame my plan, I reflect back on prior sprints to analyze what went well and what needed improvement.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>We have used user stories as part of our design and development process for many years. You could find several mentions of them throughout our playbook. We used user stories to give designers and developers context to the problems that the user is having and give space for them to solve that problem while building the product.</p>
